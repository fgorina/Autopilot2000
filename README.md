### Autopilot 2000 - Bridge between Pypilot and NMEA 2000

The objective of this project is to make a Pypilot available as a NMEA2000 directly
so other devices recognize it as a full autopilot and may be used
to control it.

Specifically I wat an ORCA Core to detect and accept it so it may be controlled
from the ORCA application.
